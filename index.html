We're based in Sunnyvale, CA. We develop server-side and web apps, mostly in Java, Ruby and C++.</p><h2 id="how-we-work">How We Work</h2><p>The way we develop software is absolutely unique and revolutionary. We basically <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">invented</a> it.</p><p>For every project we organize a <strong>distributed team</strong> of programmers who work on a contractual basis.</p><p>We break the project scope down to <strong>thousands of micro-tasks</strong> and compile the output into a single work product.</p><p>We ensure that every incremental task preserves the <strong>required quality</strong> of the overall project.</p><h2 id="why-are-uniquely-better">Why Are Uniquely Better</h2><p><strong>No Waste of Money</strong>, because we don't pay salaries. Our programmers are paid based on their deliverables. If for some reason they are unable to deliver or if the project no longer requires their services — you don't pay. We don't have to focus on covering our expenses, so we have more time to focus on meeting your project objectives. In some cases, we're <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html">30 times more cost efficient</a> than traditional organizations.</p><p><strong>Less Bugs</strong> because we pay people to find them. One of our project micro-tasks involves finding software bugs. Our testers are motivated to find any bugs before the final product is offered to end-users. When we start a project, we estimate how many bugs it is likely to contain, based on our extensive software testing experience. We then aim to find and fix them before the project is closed. <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">Bugs are welcome</a> in our projects because we know how to take care of them.</p><p><strong>Targeted Skills</strong> because we don't have programmers in-house. Since we don't have programmers on our payroll, you have the luxury of choosing from a vast talent market of only those professionals specifically required for your project. If your software needs to be written in Scala, we won't try to sell you in-house Python developers just to cover our expenses.</p><p><strong>Higher Quality of Code</strong> because we control quality in every micro-task. Our micro-tasks are really small in size and usually take less than 30 minutes to complete. Every single task (without exception) has to pass the <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">stringent quality checks</a> that we employ, like Checkstyle, Rubocop or FindBugs.</p><p><strong>Unlimited Talent Pool</strong> because we pay high hourly rates for the best engineers. We are willing to pay up to <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">$500/hour</a> for an exceptionally talented programmer. You can't get that person on a payroll, no matter how interesting and well-funded your project may be. However, for a part-time assignment we can hire those talented programmers for your project.</p><h2 id="our-recent-open-source-projects">Our Recent Open Source Projects</h2><p>We invest a lot of energy and efforts into open source development.
