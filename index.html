We basically <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">invented</a> it.</p><p>For every project, we organize a <strong>distributed team</strong> of programmers who work on a contractual basis.</p><p>We break the project scope down to <strong>thousands of micro tasks</strong> and compile the output into a single work product. (We have four pending patents for this mechanism.)</p><p>We ensure that every incremental task preserves the <strong>required quality</strong> of the overall project.</p><p><a href="http://www.yegor256.com"><img src="http://www.yegor256.com/images/yegor-bugayenko-192x192.png" style="width:128px;border-radius:50%;float:left;margin-right:1em;margin-bottom:1em"/></a> “I started to experiment with this idea six years ago, in 2009. I've filed a number of patents, tested it in a few dozen open source projects, and gave it a name. It's called eXtremely Distributed Software Development (<a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>). I also wrote a number of articles about it on <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/tag/xdsd.html">my blog</a>. Interested in learning more? Just <a href="mailto:yegor@teamed.io">email me</a> and we'll chat.”</p><p style="text-align:right"> — Yegor Bugayenko<br/> CTO of Teamed.io</p><p><span id="portfolio"></span></p><h2 id="enjoy-the-quality-of-code">Enjoy the Quality of Code</h2><p>The quality of code we produce is higher than any other software team can deliver simply because: 1) our quality controls are <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">very strict</a>, and 2) we apply them after each change.</p><p>Our teams are also working on open source projects, so you can check our code and compare it with what you've seen before from other teams and other programmers. Also, check out the way we manage projects. All project communications are open in <a href="https://github.com/teamed">GitHub</a>. Take a look at these recent projects:</p><p class="double"> <a href="http://www.takes.org"> <img src="http://www.takes.org/clapper.jpg" style="width:96px;height:96px" alt="takes logo"/></a> <a href="http://www.takes.org">takes.org</a> — a true object-oriented and immutable Java web framework for UI web apps and RESTful APIs that serves as an OOP alternative to Spring, Play Framework, and other dinosaurs.</p><p class="double"> <a href="http://www.rultor.com"> <img src="http://doc.rultor.com/images/logo.svg" style="width:64px;height:64px" alt="rultor logo"/></a> <a href="http://www.rultor.com">rultor.com</a> — a virtual DevOps assistant that automates merge, release, and deploy operations in on-demand Docker containers and communicates with over 100 open source projects through GitHub.</p><p class="double"> <a href="http://www.jcabi.com"> <img src="http://img.jcabi.com/logo-square.svg" style="width:64px;height:64px" alt="jcabi logo"/></a> <a href="http://www.jcabi.com">jcabi.com</a> — useful Java components, including <a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-aspects">AOP aspects</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-dynamo">DynamoDB SDK</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-mysql-maven-plugin">MySQL Maven Plugin</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-github">GitHub API</a>, etc., all built with strict OOP principles in mind.</p><p>Also see <a href="http://at.teamed.io/portfolio.html">our full portfolio</a>.</p><p>Again, we produce higher quality of code because we control quality in every micro task. Our micro tasks are really small in size and usually take less than 30 minutes to complete. Every single task (without exception) has to pass the <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html">stringent quality checks</a> that we employ, like Checkstyle, Rubocop, or FindBugs.</p><h2 id="pay-a-few-times-less">Pay a Few Times Less</h2><p>There is no wasted money here, because we don't pay <strong>salaries</strong>. Our programmers are paid based on their deliverables. If, for some reason, they are unable to deliver, or if the project no longer requires their services — you don't pay. We don't have to focus on covering our expenses, so we have more time to focus on meeting your project objectives.</p><p>In some cases, we're <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html">30 times more cost-efficient</a> than traditional organizations.</p><p><span id="pool"></span></p><h2 id="access-a-literally-unlimited-talent-pool">Access a Literally Unlimited Talent Pool</h2><p>You get targeted skills because we don't have programmers in house. Since we don't have programmers on our payroll, you have the luxury of choosing from a vast talent market of only those professionals specifically required for your project. If your software needs to be written in Scala, we won't try to sell you in-house Python developers just to cover our expenses.</p><p>You get access to an unlimited talent pool because we pay high hourly rates for the best engineers. We are willing to pay up to <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html">$500 per hour</a> for an exceptionally talented programmer. You can't get that person on a payroll, no matter how interesting and well-funded your project may be. However, for a part-time assignment, we can hire those talented programmers for your project.</p><p>We may work with almost any technology stack, but we prefer open source technologies on Linux, especially:</p><p class="double"> <img src="/images/tech/java.jpg" style="width:64px;height:64px"/> Java, Groovy, Hadoop, AOP/AspectJ, JAX-RS, XML, XSLT, JUnit, Maven, Mockito</p><p class="double"> <img src="/images/tech/aws.jpg" style="width:128px;height:52px"/> EC2, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, SNS, SQS, CloudFront, SES</p><p class="double"> <img src="/images/tech/database.png" style="width:64px;height:64px"/> PostgreSQL, H2, DynamoDB, MongoDB, SimpleDB</p><p class="double"> <img src="/images/tech/html5.png" style="width:64px;height:64px"/> JavaScript, jQuery, SASS, AngularJS, node.js, HTML5, CSS3, PhantomJS, CasperJS</p><p class="double"> <img src="/images/tech/wheel.png" style="width:64px;height:64px"/> GitHub, Rultor, Travis, Docker, Continuous Integration, Build Automation, TDD, Static Analysis</p><p class="help"> There are some technologies we prefer <strong>not</strong> to work with, as well, including: PHP, Python, Ant, Azure, utility classes, MySQL, getters and setters, .Net, copy &amp; paste, Subversion, JIRA/Bitbucket, Scrum, daily standups, singletons, Windows, Adobe Flash, ORM, Perl, Spring Framework, RPC, NULL references, Selenium, PowerMock</p><p><span id="team"></span></p><h2 id="check-out-ourbest-developers">Check Out Our<br/>Best Developers</h2><p>Even though we build a custom team for each project, some developers have remained with us for a long time, participating in many projects simply because they are <strong>the best</strong> (in alphabetic order):</p><p class="double"> <a href="https://github.com/caarlos0"><img src="/images/team/caarlos0.png" style="width:96px;height:96px;border-radius:50%"/></a> <a href="https://github.com/caarlos0">@caarlos0</a> is a software developer based in Joinville, SC, Brazil.
