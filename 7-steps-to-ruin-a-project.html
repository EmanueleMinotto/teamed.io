Soon enough.</p><ol><li><p>Don't waste time on <strong>unit tests</strong>. They are mostly for academic experiments. Serious commercial projects simply don't have time for that. Seriously, customer satisfaction is what matters, not the quality of code.</p></li><li><p>Trust your programmers and <strong>never check</strong> their code. Code reviews will only insult your best engineers and they may leave. And never try to enforce any coding standards. Be nice to your colleagues!</p></li><li><p>Don't offend your team by setting <strong>deadlines</strong>. Good and professional developers hate any kind of time pressures and will leave your team if you stress them. Let them work as fast as they can.</p></li><li><p>Make <strong>democratic</strong> decisions in all technical disputes. Only an open voting of the entire team can guarantee that the technical choice you're making is right. Long and open discussions should always preceed any decision making.</p></li><li><p>Don't make anyone <strong>personally responsibile</strong> for anything. The entire team should always share the responsibility. If something goes wrong, never try to find who's fault it was.

Good programmers test their own code and make sure it works, before they deliver it to production.</p></li><li><p>Resolve all conflicts by <strong>compromises</strong>. First of all, conflicts should be avoided in the office, at all cost.
