      If you are passionate about software development and
      committed to quality, we want to work with you. Our
      coding standards are unexpectedly high for most newcomers.
      Moreover, our work model
      [differs](http://www.xdsd.org/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html)
      from everything you've seen before.
      But don't be scared; just be ready to improve yourself&nbsp;:)

        We offer a flexible part-time job you can work from anywhere.
        In most cases, we expect you to spend up to 10 hours per week,
        blending our projects into your other full-time work.
      - |
        Our projects are both challenging and interesting. You will solve
        difficult problems, work with cutting-edge technologies, and collaborate
        with skilled professionals. There are no routine or boring tasks here.
      - |
        You can expect to work on small, well-defined tasks (usually
        30 minutes each) personally selected to fit with your skills
        and experience. We even encourage our developers to reject tasks
        if you don't feel like they're a good fit.

      We pay you immediately after a task is completed, either
      through [oDesk](http://www.odesk.com) or [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com),
      according to the budget allocated for the task multiplied by your hourly rate.
      Say, for example, that your rate is $50/hour and the task budget is 30
      minutes. You will get $25 immediately after the task is completed.
      Here is a [sample](http://img.tpc2.com/agreement.pdf) of our contract.
