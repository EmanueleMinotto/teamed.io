        <h1>Self-improving jobs</h1>
        It's a part-time job and you can work from
        anywhere. In most cases we expect you to spend up to ten hours per week. You are
        supposed to combine our projects with your full-time work.
        <p>
            It's challenging and interesting. You will
            solve difficult problems, work with cutting edge technologies, and collaborate
            with professionals. No routine or boring tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will work with small fixed-scope tasks (usually
            30 minutes each), which will perfectly fit your skills and experience.
            We even encourage our developers to reject tasks if they
            don't feel like doing them.
