We want to work with you if you are passionate about software development
and its quality aspect. Beware that our coding standards are unexpectedly high
for most of new comers. Don't be afraid, but be ready to improve :)

It's a part-time job and you can work from
anywhere. In most cases we expect you to spend up to ten hours per week. You are
supposed to combine our projects with your full-time work.

It's challenging and interesting. You will
solve difficult problems, work with cutting edge technologies, and collaborate
with professionals. No routine or boring tasks.

You will work with small fixed-scope tasks (usually
30 minutes each), which will perfectly fit your skills and experience.
We even encourage our developers to reject tasks if they
don't feel like doing them.

We pay immediately after the task is completed,
through [Odesk](http://www.odesk.com) or [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com),
the budget allocated for the task multiplied by your hourly rate.
Say, your rate is $50/hour and task budget is 30
minutes. You will get $25 immediately after the task is completed.
Here is a [sample](http://img.tpc2.com/agreement.pdf) of our contract.

When you are ready to join, send us your Github account and StackOverflow
profile. Yes, we expect people passionate about software development be
active contributors to open source projects and regularly spend time
on StackOverflow. Please send that links together with your CV to
[dev@teamed.io](mailto:dev@teamed.io).
