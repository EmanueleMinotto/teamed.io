<h1>Looking for a Job?</h1>

We want to work with you if you have something exceptional, e.g. skills,
certifications, experience, or price:

1. It’s a part-time job and you can work from
anywhere. In most cases we expect you to spend 3-10 hours per week. You can
easily combine our projects with your full-time work.

2. It’s challenging and interesting. You will
solve difficult problems, work with cutting edge technologies, and collaborate
with professionals. No routine or boring tasks.

3. You will work with small fixed-scope tasks (usually
30 minutes each), which perfectly fit your skills and experience. You
may reject any task assigned to you, if you don’t like it, for any reason —
we’ll find more suitable tasks for you.

4. We pay immediately after the task is completed,
through [Odesk](http://www.odesk.com) or [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com). All
fees are paid by us, you get exactly the budget allocated for the task
multiplied by your hourly rate. Say, your rate is $50/hour and task budget is 30
minutes. You will get $25 immediately after the task is completed.
