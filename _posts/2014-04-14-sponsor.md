      You need to grow by developing new software. You need more technical and management
      resources. You need a lot of them and very soon. You could opt for head-hunting or
      you could try outsourcing. However, if you are savvy enough, there is a better
      way: Team as a Service&reg;.

      We give you a distributed team of highly qualified programmers, all working
      remotely from their home countries. We assign them tasks and monitor their
      performance. We take responsibility for the end result and milestones.

      Due to our unique management model, we can deliver much higher quality than many
      other software teams. First, our rules are very strict: unit tests,
      mandatory static analysis, pre-flight builds and continuous delivery.
      Second, we pay only for deliverables that pass our quality checks. This
      combination ensures outstanding results.

      Since we don't have programmers on our payroll, we have the luxury of choosing from
      a vast talent market only those professionals specifically required for your project.
      If it needs to be written in Scala, we won't try to sell you in-house Python developers
      just to cover our expenses. Unlike most software teams, programmers are not a burden
      to us.
