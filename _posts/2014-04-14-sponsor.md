        <h1>Grow in a better way</h1>
        You need to grow by making new software. You need more technical and management
        resources. You need many of them and very soon. You can go for head-hunting or
        you can try outsourcing. However, if you are savvy enough, there is a better
        way: Team as a Service&reg;.

        <h1>No office expenses</h1>
        We give you a distributed team of highly qualified programmers. All of them work
        remotely from their home countries. We give them tasks and control their
        outputs. We stay responsible for the end result and milestones.

        <h1>Pay for quality</h1>
        Due to our unique management model, we can deliver much higher quality than many
        other software teams. First, our rules are very strict:
        <ul>
            <li>unit tests first</li>
            <li>strict static analysis</li>
            <li>pre-flight builds and continuous delivery</li>
        </ul>
        Second, we pay only
        for deliverables that pass our quality checks and never make compromises. This
        combination gives outstanding results.

        <h1>Distributed skills</h1>
        Since we don't have programmers on payroll, we have a luxury of choosing people
        from the market, specifically required for your project. If it needs to be
        written in Scala, we won't try to sell you in-house Python developers, just
        to cover our expenses. Unlike most software teams, programmers are not a burden
        for us.
