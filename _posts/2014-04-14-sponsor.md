      You need to grow by making new software. You need more technical and management
      resources. You need many of them and very soon. You can go for head-hunting or
      you can try outsourcing. However, if you are savvy enough, there is a better
      way: Team as a Service&reg;.

      We give you a distributed team of highly qualified programmers. All of them work
      remotely from their home countries. We give them tasks and control their
      outputs. We stay responsible for the end result and milestones.

      Due to our unique management model, we can deliver much higher quality than many
      other software teams. First, our rules are very strict: unit tests first,
      mandatory static analysis, pre-flight builds and continuous delivery.
      Second, we pay only for deliverables that pass our quality checks. This
      combination gives outstanding results.

      Since we don't have programmers on payroll, we have a luxury of choosing people
      from the market, specifically required for your project. If it needs to be
      written in Scala, we won't try to sell you in-house Python developers, just
      to cover our expenses. Unlike most software teams, programmers are not a burden
      for us.
