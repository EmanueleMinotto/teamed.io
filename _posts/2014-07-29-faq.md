# What is Our Technogy Stack?

We prefer to develop Java web applications. Besides that,
we're good in Java command line tools, Android apps, Maven plugins,
Java libraries.

We like NoSQL databases, especially MongoDB and Amazon DynamoDB.
Amazon SimpleDB is also a technology we would use for a non-relational
data storage. Among relational databases we prefer PostgreSQL.

We're big fans of cloud computing, especially Amazon Web Services
and OpenStack.

Other languages we are using are Ruby and JavaScript.

We don't work with any Microsoft technologies, like .Net, Windows, etc.
