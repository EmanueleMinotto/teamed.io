Yegor Bugayenko<br/>
Co-founder and CTO<br/>
<a href="http://www.yegor256.com">yegor256.com</a>
</div>

**Teamed.io** is a custom software development company,
founded by [Yegor Bugayenko](http://www.yegor256.com)
and [TechnoPark Corp.](http://www.technoparkcorp.com) in 2014.
We're based in Sunnyvale, CA. We develop server-side and web apps,
mostly in Java, Ruby and C++.

## How We Work

The way we develop software is absolutely unique
and revolutionary. We basically [invented](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html) it.

For every project we organize a **distributed team**
of programmers who work on a contractual basis.

We break the project scope down to **thousands of micro-tasks**
and compile the output into a single work product.

We ensure that every incremental task preserves the **required quality**
of the overall project.

## Why Are Uniquely Better

**No Waste of Money**, because we don't pay salaries.
Our programmers are paid based on their deliverables. If for some reason they
are unable to deliver or if the project no longer requires their services
&mdash; you don't pay. We don't have to focus on covering our expenses, so we have more
time to focus on meeting your project objectives. In some cases,
we're [30 times more cost efficient](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html)
than traditional organizations.

**Less Bugs** because we pay people to find them.
One of our project micro-tasks involves finding software bugs. Our testers
are motivated to find any bugs before the final product
is offered to end-users. When we start a project, we
estimate how many bugs it is likely to contain, based on our extensive software
testing experience. We then aim to find and fix them before the project is closed.
[Bugs are welcome](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html)
in our projects because we know how to take care of them.

**Targeted Skills** because we don't have programmers in-house.
Since we don't have programmers on our payroll, you have
the luxury of choosing from a vast talent market of only
those professionals specifically required for your project.
If your software needs to be written in Scala, we won't try to sell
you in-house Python developers just to cover our expenses.

**Higher Quality of Code** because we control quality in every micro-task.
Our micro-tasks are really small in size and usually take less than
30 minutes to complete. Every single task (without exception)
has to pass the [stringent quality checks](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html)
that we employ, like Checkstyle, Rubocop or FindBugs.

**Unlimited Talent Pool** because we pay high hourly rates for the best engineers.
We are willing to pay up to [$500/hour](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html)
for an exceptionally talented programmer.
You can't get that person on a payroll, no matter
how interesting and well-funded your project may be. However, for a part-time
assignment we can hire those talented programmers for your project.

## Our Recent Open Source Projects

We invest a lot of energy and efforts into open source development. You can

## We Are Hiring

If you are passionate about software development
and quality, we want to work with you. You should know,
though, that our [coding standards](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html) are unexpectedly high
for most newcomers. Moreover, our work model
[differs](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html)
from anything  you've probably seen before. But you
shouldnâ€™t be scared &mdash; just ready to improve &nbsp;:)

We offer flexible part-time work that you can perform
from anywhere.  In most cases, we expect you to spend up
to 10 hours per week blending our projects into your other full-time work.

Our projects are both challenging and interesting. You
will solve difficult problems, work with cutting-edge technologies
and collaborate with skilled professionals. There are no
routine or boring tasks here.

You should expect to work on small, well-defined tasks
(usually 30 minutes each) personally selected to fit your
skills experience. We even encourage our developers to reject
tasks if they don't feel like they're a good fit.

We pay you immediately after a task is completed, either
through [Upwork](http://www.upwork.com) or [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com),
according to the budget allocated for the task multiplied by your hourly rate.
Say, for example, that your rate is [$50/hour](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html)
and the task budget is 30 minutes.
You will get $25 immediately after the task is completed. Here is a
[sample](/engineer.pdf) of our contract.

When you are ready to join, read [this article](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html)
and send us your GitHub account and
StackOverflow  profile, as we expect people passionate about
software development to be active contributors to open-source
projects and regularly spend time on StackOverflow. Please send
them, together with your CV, to
[dev@teamed.io](mailto:dev@teamed.io).
