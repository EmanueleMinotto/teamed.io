## Hire a remotely<br/> <del>managed</del> orchestrated<br/>team of developers

Explain us your requirements, be it a web system, a mobile app,
or a Big Data who-knows-what. We will give you our best team of
free-lancers, all working remotely. We will <strong>orchestrate</strong> their work,
keeping you an active participant of the project.

No product owners on duty here or weekly updates! You're the <strong>product owner</strong> and
all programmers will communicate with you directly and immediately, about
features and functionality. Although, all management overhead is ours.

440 North Wolfe Road, #61<br/>
Sunnyvale, CA 94085<br/>

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/teamed-io),
[AngelList](https://angel.co/teamed-io),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/yegor256).

Yes, we're based in <strong>Silicon Valley</strong>, but developers
are all remote, from 15+ countries, including Poland,
Philippines, Brazil, Russia, France, Ukraine, and United States.

## Learn how it works

The way we develop software is absolutely unique
and revolutionary. We basically [invented](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html) it.

For every project we organize a **distributed team**
of programmers who work on a contractual basis.

We break the project scope down to **thousands of micro-tasks**
and compile the output into a single work product
(four pending patents about this mechanism).

We ensure that every incremental task preserves the **required quality**
of the overall project.

  style="width:128px;border-radius:50%;float:left;margin-right:1em;margin-bottom:1em"/></a>
&ldquo;I started to experiment with this idea six years ago, in 2009. Filed
a number of patents, tested in a few dozens of open source projects and gave it a name. It's called
eXtremely Distributed Software Development ([XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org)).
I wrote a number of articles about it, on [my blog](http://www.yegor256.com/tag/xdsd.html).
Interested in learning more about it? Just [email me](mailto:yegor@teamed.io),
we'll chat.&rdquo; &mdash; Yegor Bugayenko, CTO of Teamed.io

<span id="portfolio"></span>
## Enjoy the quality of code

The quality of code we produce is higher than any other software
team can deliver. Simply because 1) our quality controls are
[very strict](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html)
and 2) we apply them after each change.

Our teams are also working in open source projects, so you can
check our code and compare it with what you've seen before, in other
teams and from other programmers. Also, see the way we manage projects. All
project communications are open, in
[Github](https://github.com/teamed). Check these recent
projects:

<a href="https://github.com/jcabi/jcabi-mysql-maven-plugin">MySQL Maven Plugin</a>,

all built with strict OOP principles in mind.

</p>

Also see [our full portfolio](/portfolio.html).

Again, we produce higher quality of code because we control quality in every micro-task.
Our micro-tasks are really small in size and usually take less than
30 minutes to complete. Every single task (without exception)
has to pass the [stringent quality checks](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html)
that we employ, like Checkstyle, Rubocop or FindBugs.

## Pay a few times less

There is no waste of money here, because we don't pay <strong>salaries</strong>.
Our programmers are paid based on their deliverables. If, for some reason, they
are unable to deliver or if the project no longer requires their services
&mdash; you don't pay. We don't have to focus on covering our expenses, so we have more
time to focus on meeting your project objectives. In some cases,
we're [30 times more cost efficient](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html)
than traditional organizations.

<span id="pool"></span>
## Access a literally unlimited talent pool

You get targeted skills because we don't have programmers in-house.
Since we don't have programmers on our payroll, you have
the luxury of choosing from a vast talent market of only
those professionals specifically required for your project.
If your software needs to be written in Scala, we won't try to sell
you in-house Python developers just to cover our expenses.

You get an access to an unlimited talent pool
because we pay high hourly rates for the best engineers.
We are willing to pay up to [$500/hour](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html)
for an exceptionally talented programmer.
You can't get that person on a payroll, no matter
how interesting and well-funded your project may be. However, for a part-time
assignment we can hire those talented programmers for your project.

We may work with almost any technology stack, but we prefer open source
technologies on Linux, especially:

<p class="double">
<img src="/images/tech/java.jpg" style="width:64px;height:64px;"/>
Java, Groovy, Hadoop, AOP/AspectJ,
JAX-RS, XML, XSLT, JUnit, Maven, Mockito
</p>

<p class="double">
<img src="/images/tech/aws.jpg" style="width:128px;height:52px;"/>
EC2, S3, Elastic Beanstalk, DynamoDB, CloudWatch,
SNS, SQS, CloudFront, SES
</p>

<p class="double">
<img src="/images/tech/database.png" style="width:64px;height:64px;"/>
PostgreSQL, H2, DynamoDB,
MongoDB, SimpleDB
</p>

<p class="double">
<img src="/images/tech/html5.png" style="width:64px;height:64px;"/>
JavaScript, jQuery, SASS, AngularJS,
node.js, HTML5, CSS3, PhantomJS, CasperJS
</p>

<p class="double">
<img src="/images/tech/wheel.png" style="width:64px;height:64px;"/>
Github, Rultor, Travis, Docker, Continuous Integration,
Build Automation, TDD, Static Analysis
</p>

<p class="help">
  There are some technologies that we prefer <strong>not</strong> to work with,
  including: PHP, Python, Ant, Azure, utility classes,
  MySQL, getters and setters, .Net, copy &amp; paste,
  Subversion, JIRA/Bitbucket, Scrum, daily standups,
  singletons, Windows, Adobe Flash, ORM, Perl, Spring Framework, RPC,
  NULL references, Selenium, PowerMock.

## You're a good programmer?<br/> Try to join us

If you are passionate about software development
and quality, we want to work with you. You should know,
though, that our [coding standards](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html) are unexpectedly high
for most newcomers. Moreover, our work model
[differs](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html)
from anything  you've probably seen before. But you
shouldn’t be scared &mdash; just ready to improve &nbsp;:)

We offer flexible part-time work that you can perform
from anywhere.  In most cases, we expect you to spend up
to 10 hours per week blending our projects into your other full-time work.

Our projects are both challenging and interesting. You
will solve difficult problems, work with cutting-edge technologies
and collaborate with skilled professionals. There are no
routine or boring tasks here.

You should expect to work on small, well-defined tasks
(usually 30 minutes each) personally selected to fit your
skills experience. We even [encourage](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html)
our developers to reject
tasks if they don't feel like they're a good fit.

We pay you immediately after a task is completed, either
through [Upwork](http://www.upwork.com) or [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com),
according to the budget allocated for the task multiplied by your hourly rate.
Say, for example, that your rate is [$50/hour](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html)
and the task budget is 30 minutes.
You will get $25 immediately after the task is completed. Here is a
[sample](/engineer.pdf) of our contract.
