intro: |
  The way we develop software is absolutely unique
  and revolutionary. We **invented** it.
hows:
  Distributed Team:
    img: /images/keys/people.svg
    text: |
      For every project we organize a **distributed team**
      of programmers who work on a contractual basis.
  Transparency:
    img: /images/keys/dollar.svg
    text: |
      We break the project scope down to **thousands of micro-tasks**
      and compile the output into a single work product.
  Quality:
    img: /images/keys/basket.svg
    text: |
      We ensure that every incremental task
      preserves the **required quality**
      of the overall project.
diffs:
  1:
    title: No Waste of Money
    reason: we don't pay salaries
    details: |
      Our programmers are paid based on their deliverables. If for some reason they
      are unable to deliver or if the project no longer requires their services
      &mdash; you don't pay. We don't have to focus on covering our expenses, so we have more
      time to focus on meeting your project objectives. In some cases,
      we're [30 times more cost efficient](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html)
      than traditional organizations.
  2:
    title: Less Bugs
    reason: we pay people to find them
    details: |
      One of our project micro-tasks involves finding software bugs. Our testers
      are motivated to find any bugs before the final product
      is offered to end-users. When we start a project, we
      estimate how many bugs it is likely to contain, based on our extensive software
      testing experience. We then aim to find and fix them before the project is closed.
      [Bugs are welcome](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html)
      in our projects because we know how to take care of them.
  3:
    title: Targeted Skills
    reason: we don't have programmers in-house
    details: |
      Since we don't have programmers on our payroll, you have
      the luxury of choosing from a vast talent market of only
      those professionals specifically required for your project.
      If your software needs to be written in Scala, we won't try to sell
      you in-house Python developers just to cover our expenses.
  4:
    title: Higher Quality of Code
    reason: we control quality in every micro-task
    details: |
      Our micro-tasks are really small in size and usually take less than
      30 minutes to complete. Every single task (without exception)
      has to pass the [stringent quality checks](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html)
      that we employ, like Checkstyle, Rubocop or FindBugs.
  5:
    title: Unlimited Talent Pool
    reason: we pay high hourly rates for the best engineers
    details: |
      We are willing to pay up to [$500/hour](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html)
      for an exceptionally talented programmer.
      You can't get that person on a payroll, no matter
      how interesting and well-funded your project may be. However, for a part-time
      assignment we can hire those talented programmers for your project.
