      If you are passionate about software development
      and quality, we want to work with you. You should know,
      though, that our [coding standards](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/08/13/strict-code-quality-control.html) are unexpectedly high
      for most newcomers. Moreover, our work model
      [differs](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html)
      from anything  you've probably seen before. But you
      shouldnâ€™t be scared &mdash; just ready to improve &nbsp;:)

        We offer flexible part-time work that you can perform
        from anywhere.  In most cases, we expect you to spend up
        to 10 hours per week blending our projects into your other full-time work.
      - |
        Our projects are both challenging and interesting. You
        will solve difficult problems, work with cutting-edge technologies
        and collaborate with skilled professionals. There are no
        routine or boring tasks here.
      - |
        You should expect to work on small, well-defined tasks
        (usually 30 minutes each) personally selected to fit your
        skills experience. We even encourage our developers to reject
        tasks if they don't feel like they're a good fit.

      We pay you immediately after a task is completed, either
      through [oDesk](http://www.odesk.com) or [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com),
      according to the budget allocated for the task multiplied by your hourly rate.
      Say, for example, that your rate is [$50/hour](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/29/how-much-do-you-cost.html)
      and the task budget is 30 minutes.
      You will get $25 immediately after the task is completed. Here is a
      [sample](/engineer.pdf) of our contract.
