An average team for a 5-30 KLoC project consists
of a core (six actively working people) and 20-40 people
helping them time to time. The core of the team
will look like this:

**One Architect**.
10+ years experience, PhD/MSc, Sun/Oracle Certified Java Architect (SCEA).
Examples: [@yegor256](https://github.com/yegor256).
Rate: $80-150/hr.

**Two Java Designers**.
5+ years experience, MSc, Java Certified Professional (JCP).
Examples:
[@krzyk](https://github.com/krzyk),
[@carlosmiranda](https://github.com/carlosmiranda),
[@longtimeago](https://github.com/longtimeago),
[@caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0)
Rate: $25-50/hr.

**Three Java Developers**.
3+ years experience, MSc.
Examples:
[@lthuangiang](https://github.com/lthuangiang),
[@aistomin](https://github.com/aistomin),
[@hildo](https://github.com/hildo),
Rate: $15-30/hr.

When necessary, we also invite manual testers, code
reviewers, system analysts, database designers, performance
testers, and graphic artists.

To get an idea of how much the project will cost, use
our [calculator](/calculator.html). Remember, we produce
[ten times](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/11/cost-of-loc.html) (!)
more results in one hour than any other team.
