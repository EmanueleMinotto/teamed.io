A programmer sitting in your office from 9 til 5, on a full-time,
annual payroll is a **burden** to your business, not a forward driver.

1. He spends most of his office time **pretending to be working**. He
sits in on the meetings, drinks coffee, discusses important things, but
doesn't produce anything. Why would he? You're paying him either way, every
second week.

2. He doesn't grow professionally. He is using one tech stack,
one business domain, and doesn't care much about the rest. He gets
stuck in your business and eventually starts **to degrade**.

3. He is **afraid to argue** with you, because his job is everything
for him. It's his mortgage, his insurance, and his car. He doesn't want
to do things right &mdash; he wants to please his boss, which is,
in most cases, not the same thing.

4. You're afraid to fire him because you will lose a "knowledgeable"
expert, and who knows what will happen to the product then. You have to pay
him and hope for the best. **He controls you**, not the other way around.

You know, there is a better way to develop software...
