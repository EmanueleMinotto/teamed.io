This policy regulates all work relationship between Teamed.io
and you, a remote team member. We follow the principles of
eXtremely Distributed Softare Development ([XDSD](http://www.xdsd.org)) methodology. Read
[how XDSD is different](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html) from others.
Also, see our [FAQ](/faq.html).

{% par 1 %}
When we start working with you, you get a few tasks in a few of our
[campus projects](/campus.html). They are paid, managed and rated the same
way as all other tasks, but the projects are open source, hosted in Github.

{% par 2 %}
Once we see that you're capable to work in a commercial project,
we electronically sign a formal [contract](/engineer.pdf) with you and invite you to
a few commercial projects.

{% par 3 %}
We communicate with you via [netbout.com](http://www.netbout.com). Please, create
an account there and send its name to us by [email](mailto:dev@teamed.io).

{% par 4 %}
Project communications are kept solely in tickets. We don't use any other
communication tools, like emails, Skype, phone, conferences, or chats.

[Stop Chatting, Start Coding](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html).

{% par 5 %}
Each task has a pre-defined budget, in minutes, which is announced by the project
manager. The budget is not negotiable. When the task is done
you get the payment equal to the amount of minutes in the budget multiplied
by your hourly rate, no matter how much time you actually spent.

{% par 6 %}
Our Definition of Done is simple: the task is done if
its author accepts the deliverables.
Read this article: [Definition Of Done](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html).

{% par 7 %}
If you don't complete the task, you get no payment, no matter what
was the reason of incompletion, including someone else's mistakes.

{% par 8 %}
For a code review task you get 15 minutes plus as many minutes
as many comments you posted in the discussion. Either you accept
the code or reject it, you still get the payment.

{% par 9 %}
If you don't want to work with a task, for any reason, post a message
to the project manager, asking to "_assign someone else_". You lose
as many points in this case as many minutes the task has in budget.

{% par 23 %}
If you want to stop getting new tasks for some time, inform us
through Netbout and you won't get any new assignments in all our projects,
for the desired period.

{% par 10 %}
If you can't complete a task in time, inform the project manager about it. Just
post a message to him, right in the ticket, asking for "_more time_". If he
accepts your request, you won't be penalized for any delays.

{% par 11 %}
If you can't complete a task in time because you're waiting for another
task to be completed beforehand, inform the project manager. Post a message
to him, right in the ticket, saying that you are "_waiting for #123_"
(123 is the number of the ticket you're blocked by).
If he accepts your request, you won't be penalized for any delays.

{% par 12 %}
When you find a bug in existing source code or documentation, report it
[properly](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html)
and it is accepted by the project architect, you get 15 minutes on
your account. Read this: [Bugs Are Welcome](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html).

{% par 13 %}
Small, easy to find, easy to fix, or cosmetic bugs and tasks are not paid,
even if they lead to a code change and project improvement. The
decision is made by a project architect and is not negotiable.

{% par 14 %}
When you close a task we increment your rating by as many points as many
minutes were in the task budget.

{% par 15 %}
When you complete a task we measure the speed of delivery, which is the
time interval between the moment you were informed by the project manager
about the task and the moment you were paid for its completion.

{% par 22 %}
If you complete a task in less than 24 hours, you get a 100% bonus, on top
of task's budget. If you complete in less than 48 hours, you get 50% bonus.
If you complete in less than 72 hours, you get 25% bonus.

{% par 31 %}
If you complete a task that has a boost factor attached to it, your
payment, together with the bonus, will be multiplied by that factor.

{% par 16 %}
You have 10 days to complete a task. If you fail,
no matter what was the reason of it, we assign the task to another
performer and you get twice as many negative points to your rating, as
many minutes were in the task budget.
Read this [No Obligations](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html) principle.

{% par 30 %}
If you hold a task for longer than 7 days, you may get a notice from
a project manager and as many negative points to your rating as many
minutes are in the task budget.

{% par 17 %}
At any moment of time and at our own discretion we may decide to stop
giving you tasks and eject you from any and/or all projects. This usually
happens for one of these reasons:
1) your communication skills are poor;
2) your rating is too low;
3) your code quality is low.

{% par 18 %}
If you want to increase your hourly rate, send us a message via
[netbout.com](http://www.netbout.com). There is no guarantee you will get
a raise, but these factors will be taken into account:
1) your rating, 2) your average speed of delivery, 3) your communication skills,
4) the amount of bugs you report. This article explains even more:
[How Hourly Rate Is Calculated](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/20/how-hourly-rate-is-calculated.html).

{% par 19 %}
All payment processing fees are reimbursed by us. No matter what payment
instrument is used (PayPal, oDesk, wire transfer, check, or cash) we guarantee
that you get exactly the amount you earned.

{% par 32 %}
There is a certain amount of tasks we assign to you concurrently. When
you start working with us, you have two tasks maximum. When
your rating is over 60 you get 5 tasks. When it's over 600 you get 10 tasks.
When it's over 1600 you get 20 tasks.

## Architect (ARC)

{% par 20 %}
For each release you publish as an architect you get 30 minutes plus as many minutes
as [this formula](/release.html) calculates. Release is "published" when
its status in Github is set to "final". You have to ask Project Owner to
change the status when a new version is released and it satisfies
the PO.

{% par 21 %}
Each bug has to be accepted by an architect before it is paid and dispatched
for fixing. Being an architect, when you see a new bug submitted, inform
the project manager that it is a valid bug by posting a message, similar
to "_it is a valid bug_", or explain to the reporter what is wrong with
the issue reported. Read this:
[Five Principles of Bug Tracking](http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html).

{% par 26 %}
As an architect, you can prioritize tasks into three categories: urgent, normal
and postponed. Urgent tasks are assigned to performers immediately. Normal
tasks are assigned to performers only when the project has less than ten
assigned tasks. Postponed tasks are never assigned. To change any task
priority, just ask a project manager, for example "_this task is urgent_"
or "_this task is postponed_", or "_this task is not urgent any more_"

{% par 27 %}
As an architect, you can assign any ticket to one of the project milestones.
To do that just ask a project manager, for example "_set milestone to 1.4_".

{% par 29 %}
As an architect, you can ask a project manager to assign any task to anyone,
just say, for example, "_assign @yegor256_".

{% par 28 %}
For each merged pull request you get 10 minutes, if the quality is "good",
according to [QA](/qa.html).

## Quality Assurance (QA)

{% par 24 %}
As a QA engineer, you earn 10 minutes for each ticket reviewed, according to
our [quality rules](/qa.html). You get
the payment right after you inform the project manager that the ticket
passed the review. Your message should include your measurement of the
quality, like "quality is good", "quality is acceptable" or "quality is bad".
No matter what is your remark, you get paid right after you post it.

{% par 25 %}
Ticket performer will get his/her payment only after the ticket receives
your quality review. When you give a "good" mark, the performer gets a
bonus. If you give "acceptable" mark, the performer doesn't get a bonus. When
you give "bad" mark, the performer is not paid for the ticket.

in [netbout.com](http://www.netbout.com). If you have a correction, please
submit a [pull request](https://github.com/teamed/teamed.io).
