We follow the principles of eXtremely Distributed Softare Development (<a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>) methodology.

They are paid, managed and rated the same way as all other tasks, but the projects are open source, hosted in Github.</p><p><span id='2' class='par'>§2</span> Once we see that you're capable to work in a commercial project, we electronically sign a formal <a href="/engineer.pdf">contract</a> with you and invite you to a few commercial projects.</p><p><span id='3' class='par'>§3</span> We communicate with you via <a href="http://www.netbout.com">netbout.com</a>. Please, create an account there and send its name to us by <a href="mailto:dev@teamed.io">email</a>.</p><p><span id='4' class='par'>§4</span> Project communications are kept solely in tickets. We don't use any other communication tools, like emails, Skype, phone, conferences, or chats.

The budget is not negotiable. When the task is done you get the payment equal to the amount of minutes in the budget multiplied by your hourly rate.</p><p><span id='6' class='par'>§6</span> Our Definition of Done is simple: the task is done if its author accepts the deliverables. Read this article: <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html">Definition Of Done</a>.</p><p><span id='7' class='par'>§7</span> If you don't complete the task, you get no payment, no matter what was the reason of incompletion, including someone else's mistakes.</p><p><span id='8' class='par'>§8</span> For a code review task you get 15 minutes plus as many minutes as many comments you posted in the discussion. Either you accept the code or reject it, you still get the payment.</p><p><span id='20' class='par'>§20</span> For each release you publish you get 15 minutes plus as many minutes as this formula produces: <em>(h * 0.3 + c * 2) * [c / t] * [50 * h / t]</em>. Here, <em>t</em> is the amount of hours since the previous release, <em>c</em> is the amount of commits in the release, <em>h</em> is the amount of hits-of-code in the release. Square brackets mean that the number inside can't be bigger than 1.</p><p><span id='9' class='par'>§9</span> If you don't want to work with a task, for any reason, post a message to the project manager, asking to "<em>assign someone else</em>". You don't lose any points in this case.</p><p><span id='10' class='par'>§10</span> If you can't complete a task in time, inform the project manager about it. Just post a message to him, right in the ticket, asking for "<em>more time</em>". If he accepts your request, you won't be penalized for any delays.</p><p><span id='11' class='par'>§11</span> If you can't complete a task in time because you're waiting for another task to be completed beforehand, inform the project manager. Post a message to him, right in the ticket, saying that you are "<em>waiting for #123</em>" (123 is the number of the ticket you're blocked by). If he accepts your request, you won't be penalized for any delays.</p><p><span id='12' class='par'>§12</span> When you find a bug in existing source code or documentation, report it <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html">properly</a> and it is accepted by the project architect, you get 15 minutes on your account. Read this: <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/bugs-are-welcome.html">Bugs Are Welcome</a>.</p><p><span id='21' class='par'>§21</span> Each bug has to be accepted by an architect before it is paid and dispatched for fixing. Being an architect, when you see a new bug submitted, inform the project manager that it is a valid bug by posting a message, similar to "<em>it is a valid bug</em>", or explain to the reporter what is wrong with the issue reported.

The decision is made by a project architect and is not negotiable.</p><p><span id='14' class='par'>§14</span> When you close a task we increment your rating by as many points as many minutes were in the task budget.</p><p><span id='15' class='par'>§15</span> When you complete a task we measure the speed of delivery, which is the time interval between the moment you were informed by the project manager about the task and the moment you were paid for its completion.</p><p><span id='16' class='par'>§16</span> You have 10 days to complete a task. If you fail to complete the task, no matter what was the reason of it, we assign the task to another performer and you get twice as many negative points to your rating, as many minutes were in the task budget.

This usually happens for one of these reasons: 1) your communication skills are poor; 2) your rating is too low; 3) your code quality is low.</p><p><span id='18' class='par'>§18</span> If you want to increase your hourly rate, send us a message via <a href="http://www.netbout.com">netbout.com</a>. There is no guarantee you will get a raise, but these factors will be taken into account: 1) your rating, 2) your average speed of delivery, 3) your communication skills, 4) the amount of bugs you report.

No matter what payment instrument is used (PayPal, oDesk, wire transfer, check, or cash) we guarantee that you get exactly the amount you earned.</p><p>If you have any suggestions about this policy, please submit a request in <a href="http://www.netbout.com">netbout.com</a>.
