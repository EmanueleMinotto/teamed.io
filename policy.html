The budget is not negotiable. When the task is done you get the payment equal to the amount of minutes in the budget multiplied by your hourly rate, no matter how much time you actually spent.</p><p><span id='6' class='par'><a href='policy.html#6'>§6</a></span> Our Definition of Done is simple: the task is done if its author accepts the deliverables.

Just post a message to him, right in the ticket, asking for "<em>more time</em>". If he accepts your request, you won't be penalized for any delays.</p><p><span id='11' class='par'><a href='policy.html#11'>§11</a></span> If you can't complete a task in time because you're waiting for another task to be completed beforehand, inform the project manager.

If he accepts your request, you won't be penalized for any delays.</p><p><span id='12' class='par'><a href='policy.html#12'>§12</a></span> When you find a bug in existing source code or documentation, report it <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/24/principles-of-bug-tracking.html">properly</a> and it is accepted by the project architect, you get 15 minutes on your account.

If you fail, no matter what was the reason of it, we assign the task to another performer and you get twice as many negative points to your rating, as many minutes were in the task budget.

This usually happens for one of these reasons: 1) your communication skills are poor; 2) your rating is too low; 3) your code quality is low.</p><p><span id='18' class='par'><a href='policy.html#18'>§18</a></span> If you want to increase your hourly rate, send us a message via <a href="http://www.netbout.com">netbout.com</a>. There is no guarantee you will get a raise, but these factors will be taken into account: 1) your rating, 2) your average speed of delivery, 3) your communication skills, 4) the amount of bugs you report.

Urgent tasks are assigned to performers immediately. Normal tasks are assigned to performers only when the project has less than ten assigned tasks. Postponed tasks are never assigned. To change any task priority, just ask a project manager, for example "<em>this task is urgent</em>" or "<em>this task is postponed</em>", or "<em>this task is not urgent any more</em>"</p><p><span id='27' class='par'><a href='policy.html#27'>§27</a></span> As an architect, you can assign any ticket to one of the project milestones.

You get the payment right after you inform the project manager that the ticket passed the review. Your message should include your measurement of the quality, like "quality is good", "quality is acceptable" or "quality is bad". No matter what is your remark, you get paid right after you post it.</p><p><span id='25' class='par'><a href='policy.html#25'>§25</a></span> Ticket performer will get his/her payment only after the ticket receives your quality review. When you give a "good" mark, the performer gets a bonus. If you give "acceptable" mark, the performer doesn't get a bonus. When you give "bad" mark, the performer is not paid for the ticket.</p><p>If you have any suggestions about this policy, please submit a request in <a href="http://www.netbout.com">netbout.com</a>.
