We follow the principles of eXtremely Distributed Softare Development (<a href="http://www.xdsd.org">XDSD</a>) methodology. Read <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/17/how-xdsd-is-different.html">how XDSD is different</a> from others.</p><p>When we start working with you, you get a few tasks in a few of our <a href="/campus.html">campus projects</a>. They are paid, managed and rated the same way as all other tasks, but the projects are open source, hosted in Github.</p><p>Once we see that you're capable to work in a commercial project, we electronically sign a formal <a href="/engineer.pdf">contract</a> with you and invite you to a few commercial projects.</p><p>We communicate with you via <a href="http://www.netbout.com">netbout.com</a>. Create an account there and send your account name to us by <a href="mailto:dev@teamed.io">email</a>.</p><p>Project communications are kept solely in tickets. We don't use any other communication tools, like emails, Skype, phone, conferences, or chats.

The budget is not negotiable. When the task is done you get the payment equal to the amount of minutes in the budget multiplied by your hourly rate.</p><p>Our Definition of Done is simple: the task is done iff its author accepts the deliverables. Read this article: <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/definition-of-done.html">Definition Of Done</a>.</p><p>For a code review task you get 15 minutes plus as many minutes as many comments you posted in the discussion.</p><p>If you don't want to work with a task, for any reason, post a message to the project manager, asking to "assign someone else". You don't lose any points in this case.</p><p>If you can't complete a task in time, inform the project manager about it. Just post a message to him right in the ticket, asking for "more time". If he accepts your request, you won't be penalized for any delays.</p><p>If you can't complete a task in time because you're waiting for another task to be completed beforehand, inform the project manager. Post a message to him, right in the ticket, saying that you are "waiting for #123". If he accepts your request, you won't be penalized for any delays.</p><p>When you find a bug in existing source code or documentation, report it properly and it is accepted by the project architect, you get 15 minutes on your account.</p><p>When you close a task we increment your rating by as many points as many minutes were in the task budget.</p><p>When you complete a task we measure the speed of delivery, which is the time interval between the moment you were informed by the project manager about the task and the moment you were paid for its completion.</p><p>You have 10 days to complete a task. If you fail to complete the task, no matter what was the reason of it, we assign the task to another performer and you get twice as many negative points to your rating, as many minutes were in the task budget. Read this <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/13/no-obligations-principle.html">No Obligations</a> principle.</p><p>At any moment of time and at our own discretion we may decide to stop giving you tasks and eject you from any and/or all projects. This usually happens for one of these reasons: 1) your communication skills are poor; 2) your rating is too low; 3) your code quality is low.</p><p>If you want to increase your hourly rate, send us a message via <a href="http://www.netbout.com">netbout.com</a>. There is no guarantee you will get a raise, but these factors will be taken into account: 1) your rating, 2) your average speed of delivery, 3) your communication skills, 4) the amount of bugs you report. This article explains even more: <a href="http://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/20/how-hourly-rate-is-calculated.html">How Hourly Rate Is Calculated</a>.</p><p>All payment processing fees are reimbursed by us. No matter what payment instrument is used (PayPal, oDesk, wire transfer, check, or cash) we guarantee that you get exactly the amount you earned.</p><p>If you have any suggestions about this policy, please submit a request in <a href="http://www.netbout.com">netbout.com</a>.
