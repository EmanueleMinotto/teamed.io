1. Don't waste time on **unit tests**. They are mostly for
academic experiments. Serious commercial projects simply don't have
time for that. Seriously, customer satisfaction is what matters, not
the quality of code.

2. Trust your programmers and **never check** their code. Code
reviews will only insult your best engineers and they may leave.
And never try to enforce any coding standards.
Be nice to your colleagues!

3. Don't offend your team by setting **deadlines**. Good, professional developers
hate any kind of time pressure and will leave your team if you stress
them. Let them work as fast as they can.

4. Make **democratic** decisions in all technical disputes. Only an open voting
of the entire team can guarantee that the technical choice you're making
is right. Long and open discussions should always preceed any decision making.

5. Don't make anyone **personally responsibile** for anything. The entire
team should always share the responsibility. If something goes wrong, never
try to find who's fault it was. Moreover, never blame anyone for any mistakes.

6. Don't waste time and money on **testers**. Good programmers test their
own code and make sure it works, before they deliver it to production.

7. Resolve all conflicts by **compromise**. First of all,
conflicts should be avoided in the office, at all cost. But if they happen,
you should find a compromise that will calm everybody down.

You should know, there is a better way to develop software...
