A programmer sitting in your office from 9 till 5, on a full-time
annual payrol is a **burden** to your business, not a forward driver.

First, he spends most of his office time **pretending to be working**. He
sits on the meetings, drinks coffee, discusses important things, but
doesn't produce anything. Why would he? You're paying him anyway, every
second week.

Second, he doesn't grow professionally. He is using one tech stack,
one business domain, and doesn't care much about the rest. He gets
stuck into your business and eventually starts **to degrade**.

Third, he is **afraid to argue** with you, because this job is everything
to him. It's his mortgage, his insurance, and his car. He doesn't want
to do things right &mdash; he wants to please his boss, which is,
in most cases, not the same.

Forth, you're afraid to fire him becuase you will lose a knowledge
expert and who knows what will happen to the product. You have to pay
him and hope for the best. **He controls you**, not the other way around.

You know, there is a better way...
