You are supposed to combine our projects with your full-time work.</p><p>It's challenging and interesting. You will solve difficult problems, work with cutting edge technologies, and collaborate with professionals. No routine or boring tasks.</p><p>You will work with small fixed-scope tasks (usually 30 minutes each), which will perfectly fit your skills and experience. We even encourage our developers to reject tasks if they don't feel like doing them.</p><p>We pay immediately after the task is completed, through <a href="http://www.odesk.com">Odesk</a> or <a href="http://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>. All fees are paid by us, you get exactly the budget allocated for the task multiplied by your hourly rate. Say, your rate is $50/hour and task budget is 30 minutes.
